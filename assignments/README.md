## My Assessment Repository

This repository was created as part of the Web Services and Applications assessment module for the course in the [Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics](https://www.atu.ie/courses/higher-diploma-in-science-data-analytics?_gl=1%2A1bcdos0%2A_ga%2AMTE3OTU2MzQ5LjE2OTY2MDYwMzE.%2A_ga_5R02GBYV8V%2AMTcxNDMzOTE2Ni4xMS4xLjE3MTQzMzkyMDAuMC4wLjA.) at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/). This README has been written with [Github's Documentation On READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind. You can find more about [writing in Mark Down in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

## Getting Started

This repository contains my assessment submissions for the module, showcasing the skills I have developed throughout the course in data analysis.

## Practical Assignments

*****

**- Assignment 2: Deal cards**

**Task description:** [`Deck of Cards API`](https://deckofcardsapi.com/). This is an API that simulates dealing a deck of cards. Wrote a program that "deals" (prints out) 5 cards, first I needed to shuffle, got the `deck_id`, with the `deck_id` I could get the cards. This example got two cards. From there I needed to print the value and the suit of each card and saved the file as [`assignment2-carddraw.py`](https://github.com/RodrigoDMU/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment2-carddraw.py). ***Last few marks:*** Checked if the user had drawn a pair, triple, straight, or all of the same suit and congratulate the user.

I used [openincolab](https://openincolab.com/) to generate the following clickable link. It opens the [`assignment2-carddraw.py`](https://github.com/RodrigoDMU/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment2-carddraw.py) Jupyter Notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

**- Assignment 3: Extracting data**

**Task description:** - Wrote a program that retrieves the dataset for the `exchequer account (historical series)` from the CSO, and stored it into a file called [`cso.json`](https://github.com/RodrigoDMU/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/cso.json). Uploaded this program to the same repository I used for the first assignment. Saved this assignment as [`assignment03-cso.py`](https://github.com/RodrigoDMU/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment03-cso.py). I needed to find the dataset in [CSO.ie](https://www.cso.ie/en/index.html).

I used [openincolab](https://openincolab.com/) to generate the following clickable link. It opens the [`assignment03-cso.py`](https://github.com/RodrigoDMU/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment03-cso.py) Jupyter Notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

**- Assignment 4: Risk**

**Task description:** A program was written in Python that read a file from a repository called as ['assignment04-github.py'](https://github.com/RodrigoDMU/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment04-github.py). The program then replaced all instances of the text "Andrew" with my name "Rodrigo". After making the changes, the program committed them and pushed the updated file back to the repository (authorization was required to perform this action).

I used [openincolab](https://openincolab.com/) to generate the following clickable link. It opens the [`assignment04-github.py`](https://github.com/RodrigoDMU/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment04-github.py) Jupyter Notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/RodrigoDMU/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment04-github.py">
